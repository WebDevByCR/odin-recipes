    <h3><em>A homemade Chili with the addition of macaroni and cheese = Chili Mac ‘n Cheese! This is terrifically moorish and a fabulous one pot meal. Super quick too! The key with this recipe is to turn the stove off as soon as the pasta is just cooked - it will keep cooking in the residual heat.</em></h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>
        <li>1 onion , finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 red capsicum / bell pepper , chopped</li>
        <li>500g / 1 lb ground beef (mince) , I use lean</li>
        <li>800g / 28 oz crushed canned tomato</li>
        <li>420g / 14 oz can red kidney beans , drained</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups (625 ml) beef broth (chicken broth also ok)</li>
        <li>250g / 8 oz elbow macaroni pasta (elbow pasta), uncooked</li>
        <li>2 cups (200g) shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, tasty cheese)</li>        
        <li>1/4 cup coriander / cilantro finely chopped, for garnish</li>
        <li>3 tbsp chili powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in large pot over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 minute. Then add capsicum and cook until onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go.</li>
        <li>Once the beef turns from red to brown, add remaining ingredients except cheese. Stir, bring to simmer, then turn the heat down to medium.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook for 12 minutes or until the macaroni is al dente, meaning just cooked, still a tiny bit on the firm side. It should be saucy but not tons of liquid (see video).</li>
        <li>Turn the stove OFF but leave the pot on the stove. Stir through half the cheese – it should be a bit saucy. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Top with remaining cheese, put the lid back on and leave until the cheese melts - about 2 minutes (sauce will absorb further during this period).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with coriander, if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
